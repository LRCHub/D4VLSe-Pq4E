Can't snooze on me cause I'm lit I'm livin' my raps I'm real as it get
12 be on dick, don't wanna see us win Free all the guys, I'm missing the mrn
Go outside, kids wanna take a pic And they be rappin' my lyrics and shit
You know I'm the one not the two You know I'm the one not the two

You bitch you know she lovin' the crew 4 saibt shit, they know what we do
The jects is wicked just like a zoo It ain't no runnin' when we comin' for you
These niggas be hoes but that's none new These niggas be hoes but that's none new
You know you can't lose when you with me I'm fuckin' her good, I'm deep in her kitty

A nigga move wrong, say hello to the glizzy I can't lie, that bitch stay with me
And you know, bitch, I'm talkin' bout that glizzy
When I'm with you I cannot lose
When I'm grippin' this tool

Got a cougar lookin' better than SZA Auntie keep beggin' for Trizzle
Ain't trapping he the man in the middle He cap and told, Tae paint his picture
Me and Dra Dra was just tryin' to get him Ski said the bitch stink, but she got a missile
Bucked his bri for his glick, thing, the niggas be wicked

Was my dog? But he switch lanes, I ain't even trippin
Took his soul, now the Glock in the river Got more stripes than Tigger
Them niggas be runnin' why they sayin' they clickers
He a bitch, why he tellin' hoes that he a killer

That Glock 9 small, said he wanted one bigger
Straight out the pyrex, LB tryna hit it
Want the ball back, tell them pussy niggas come get it
Shakin' ass to all facts, but the bitch ain't got rhythm
